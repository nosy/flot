# Flot [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/flot/flot.png)](https://travis-ci.org/flot/flot)

## 简介 ##

Flot是一个jQuery的Javascript绘图库。

查看例子examples/index.html;告诉你如何工作,查看源码可以快速学习如何使用.


## 安装 ##

在jQuery文件之后包含Js文件就可以了.

一般,支持HTML5 canvas都支持.

如果想支持IE9以下, 可以使用[Excanvas]
[excanvas], canvas仿真器;脚本文件可以这样使用:

```html
<!--[if lte IE 8]><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="excanvas.min.js"></script><![endif]-->
```

If it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has
support for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some
stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines
lack the VML support.

You can also try using [Flashcanvas][flashcanvas], which uses Flash to
do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML,
if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster
overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which
Flashcanvas is compatible with.

You need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive
charts because of performance improvements in event handling.


## 基本用法 ##

创建一个占位符来放置图表:

```html
<div id="placeholder"></div>
```

你需要设置div宽高,否则plot库不知道如何缩放图表. 可以这样写:

```html
<div id="placeholder" style="width:600px;height:300px"></div>
```

You can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the
placeholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property -
in that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which
results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the
placeholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception).

文档加载完后运行plot函数:

```js
$.plot($("#placeholder"), data, options);
```

Here, data is an array of data series and options is an object with
settings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the
examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the 
[API reference](API.md). Here's a quick example that'll draw a line 
from (0, 0) to (1, 1):

```js
$.plot($("#placeholder"), [ [[0, 0], [1, 1]] ], { yaxis: { max: 1 } });
```

The plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a plot
object with a couple of methods.


## 名字是什么意思? ##

First: it's pronounced with a short o, like "plot". Not like "flawed".

So "Flot" rhymes with "plot".

And if you look up "flot" in a Danish-to-English dictionary, some of
the words that come up are "good-looking", "attractive", "stylish",
"smart", "impressive", "extravagant". One of the main goals with Flot
is pretty looks.


## 有关例子注释 ##

In order to have a useful, functional example of time-series plots using time
zones, date.js from [timezone-js][timezone-js] (released under the Apache 2.0
license) and the [Olson][olson] time zone database (released to the public
domain) have been included in the examples directory.  They are used in
examples/axes-time-zones/index.html.
